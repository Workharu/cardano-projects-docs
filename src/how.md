# How Does It Work?

The platform operates by continuously collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including Project Catalyst, on-chain data, and community channels. All metrics and analytics are built from scratch to ensure transparency and accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Project Directory:**
  - A searchable, filterable list of all Cardano projects.
  - Filter by token-based, social impact, and Project Catalyst-funded initiatives.

- **Detailed Project Pages:**
  - Each project has its own page displaying key metrics.
  - For token-based projects: token price, market cap, transaction volume, and more.
  - For non-token projects: progress reports, milestone achievements, community engagement, and alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

- **Project Rating & Ranking System:**
  - Multi-metric, transparent, data-driven scores for each project.
  - Compare and rank projects within or across categories (e.g., DeFi, Social Impact, Tooling).
  - Composite scores based on community engagement, development activity, milestone completion, and more.
  - Projects can self-declare SDG alignment, providing a distinct rating for social/environmental impact.
  - Includes a "uniqueness metric" to highlight what sets each project apart.
  - The system will evolve with new metrics for even deeper insights.

- **Insightful Analytics:**
  - Tools to analyze and compare project performance.
  - Metrics for growth trends, community sentiment, developer activity, and social/development impact.

- **Real-Time Data:**
  - Live feeds from Project Catalyst and other platforms to track proposals and milestones.

This approach ensures that users have access to the most accurate, comprehensive, and actionable insights into the Cardano ecosystem.
