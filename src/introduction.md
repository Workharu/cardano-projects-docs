## Abstract

**Cardano Projects – Metrics & Insights** is a web-based platform designed to deliver comprehensive insights and tracking for all projects built on the Cardano blockchain—whether or not they have a native token. This includes:

- Tokenized projects
- Social impact initiatives
- Development projects funded through community governance (e.g., Project Catalyst)

The platform solves the challenge of fragmented information by aggregating data from multiple sources, such as on-chain data, social media, and community forums, into a single, user-friendly dashboard.

**Key goals:**

- Empower investors, developers, and community members with real-time data and performance metrics
- Provide a clear understanding of the Cardano ecosystem’s growth and impact
